adding some functions for javascript
I have added few code snippets I wrote this weekeend after doing some training on Javascript
BMI Calculator, this function can calculate the bmi of two atheletes. The atheletes properties are defined in an object and then the object has a method to do the calculation of BMI and finaly a compare between the BMI's to give the output on whose is higher
Tips calculator is a function which can be used for calculating tips based upon some desired rule.

To execute use the index.htm and run the code on Brackets 
Download the scrript and index.html to a desired location and point you code editor to that location and start the execution
